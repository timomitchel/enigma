# Enigma
In this project you’ll use Ruby to build a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm.

Introduction
Learning Goals / Areas of Focus
Practice breaking a program into logical components
Testing components in isolation and in combination
Applying Enumerable techniques in a real context
Reading text from and writing text to files
Base Expectations
You are to build an encryption engine for encrypting, decrypting, and cracking messages.

Additionally, your program will need to read messages from and output them to the file system.

Encryption Notes
The encryption is based on rotation. The character map is made up of all the lowercase letters, then the numbers, then space, then period, then comma. New lines will not appear in the message nor character map.

The Key
Each message uses a unique encryption key
The key is five digits, like 41521
The first two digits of the key are the “A” rotation (41)
The second and third digits of the key are the “B” rotation (15)
The third and fourth digits of the key are the “C” rotation (52)
The fourth and fifth digits of the key are the “D” rotation (21)
The Offsets
The date of message transmission is also factored into the encryption
Consider the date in the format DDMMYY, like 020315
Square the numeric form (412699225) and find the last four digits (9225)
The first digit is the “A offset” (9)
The second digit is the “B offset” (2)
The third digit is the “C offset” (2)
The fourth digit is the “D offset” (5)
Encrypting a Message
Four characters are encrypted at a time.
The first character is rotated forward by the “A” rotation plus the “A offset”
The second character is rotated forward by the “B” rotation plus the “B offset”
The third character is rotated forward by the “C” rotation plus the “C offset”
The fourth character is rotated forward by the “D” rotation plus the “D offset”
Decrypting a Message
The offsets and keys can be calculated by the same methods above. Then each character is rotated backwards instead of forwards.

Cracking a Key
When the key is not known, the offsets can still be calculated from the message date. We believe that each enemy message ends with the characters "..end..". Use that to determine when you’ve correctly guessed the key.

Usage
Then we’ll exercise the functionality from a Pry session:

> require './lib/enigma'
> e = Enigma.new
> my_message = "this is so secret ..end.."
> output = e.encrypt(my_message)
=> # encrypted message here
> output = e.encrypt(my_message, "12345", Date.today) #key and date are optional (gen random key and use today's date)
=> # encrypted message here
> e.decrypt(output, "12345", Date.today)
=> "this is so secret ..end.."
> e.decrypt(output, "12345") # Date is optional (use today's date)
=> "this is so secret ..end.."
> e.crack(output, Date.today)
=> "this is so secret ..end.."
> e.crack(output) # Date is optional, use today's date
=> "this is so secret ..end.."
Working with Files
In addition to the pry form above, we’ll want to use the tool from the command line like so:

$ ruby ./lib/encrypt.rb message.txt encrypted.txt
Created 'encrypted.txt' with the key 82648 and date 030415
That will take the plaintext file message.txt and create an encrypted file encrypted.txt.

Then, if we know the key, we can decrypt:

$ ruby ./lib/decrypt.rb encrypted.txt decrypted.txt 82648 030415
Created 'decrypted.txt' with the key 82648 and date 030415
But if we don’t know the key, we can try to crack it with just the date:

$ ruby ./lib/crack.rb encrypted.txt cracked.txt 030415
Created 'cracked.txt' with the cracked key 82648 and date 030415
Development Phases
As you work to implement the project here are ideas for some of your first iterations:

1. Key Generator
It’d be great if instead of random numbers we could generate a legitimate key. Starting from your runner:

Create an instance of a key generator
Figure out what, if anything, you’d need to pass in to the object
Start writing tests for the key generator object based on the specs above
Go through building the implementation
Use it from your runner to generate and output a valid key
2. Offsets
Before we can start encrypting we probably need to calculate the offsets.

From your runner, create an instance of an offset calculator
Pass the current date and the generated key into the offset calculator
Write tests and implementation around the idea of being able to pass in the date and key, then query the A, B, C, and D final rotations
3. Encryption
Now that you have all the components you’re ready to encrypt a message.

Create an encryptor object in your runner
What information would the encryptor need to be “setup” and ready to encrypt messages? Pass that in.
Call an encrypt method and pass in a string message. Get back the encrypted version.
4. Next Steps
Now you should have all the components in place such that your command-line encryption is working! Next up:

Follow a similar flow to develop the decrypt script and functionality
Swap some encrypted messages with a classmate and see if each other can decrypt them correctly
Start experimenting with the cracking functionality
Extension
Character Support
Improve your system so it supports all of the following:

all capital letters
all lowercase letters
all numbers
spaces
these symbols: !@#$%^&*()[],.<>;:/?\|
Support Tooling
Please make sure that, before your evaluation, your project has the following:

SimpleCov reporting accurate test coverage statistics
Evaluation Rubric
The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

4: Above expectations
3: Meets expectations
2: Below expectations
1: Well-below expectations
Expectations:

1. Ruby Syntax & Style
Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation
Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately
Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
Ruby methods used are logical and readable
Developer implements appropriate enumerable methods (#each is used sparingly)
Code is indented properly
Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories
2. Breaking Logic into Components
Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
Developer writes methods less than 8 lines
No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP
3. Test-Driven Development
Each method is tested
Functionality is accurately covered
Tests implement Ruby syntax & style
Balances unit and integration tests
Evidence of edge cases testing
Test Coverage metrics are present (SimpleCov)
4. Functionality
Application meets all requirements (extension not req’d)
